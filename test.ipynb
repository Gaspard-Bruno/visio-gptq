The modern understanding of black holes, however, comes from Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of space-time.\\n\"\n",
    "        \"According to general relativity, the mass of an object curves the fabric of space-time around it, creating a gravitational field. The stronger the gravitational field, the more the fabric of space-time is curved. When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against the force of gravity and begins to collapse. As the star's core collapses, it becomes denser and denser, eventually reaching a point where it collapses to a single point of zero volume and infinite density, known as a singularity. \"\n",
    "        \"The region surrounding the singularity is called the event horizon, which is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is pulled towards the singularity, and its fate is sealed. \"\n",
    "        \"One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the existence of black holes comes from observations of stars orbiting around invisible companions. By measuring the motion of the stars, astronomers can infer the mass and size of the invisible companion, which can only be explained by the presence of a black hole. \"\n",
    "        \"Another piece of evidence comes from the observation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are incredibly luminous sources of energy at the centers of galaxies. AGN are thought to be powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole, which can release enormous amounts of energy as the matter heats up and spirals towards the singularity.\\n\"\n",
    "        \"In summary, black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravitational force, creating a singularity surrounded by an event horizon. The existence of black holes is supported by a range of observations, from the motion of stars around invisible companions to the behavior of active galactic nuclei. While there is still much to be learned about these mysterious objects, they continue to fascinate and intrigue astronomers and physicists alike.\"\n",
